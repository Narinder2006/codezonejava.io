      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <p>
        Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other
        three are inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Encapsulation in
        Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on
        the data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the
        variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be
        accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it
        is also known as data hiding.
      </p>
      <h4>To achieve encapsulation in Java −</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Declare the variables of a class as private.</li>
        <li>
          Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the
          variables values.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Data abstraction</h3>
      <p>
        Data abstraction is the programming process of creating a data type,
        usually a class, that hides the details of the data representation in
        order to make the data type easier to work with. Data abstraction
        involves creating a representation for data that separates the interface
        from the implementation so a programmer or user only has to understand
        the interface, the commands to use, and not how the internal structure
        of the data is represented and/or implemented.
      </p>

      <h3>Inheritence</h3>
      <p>
        The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from
        another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most
        important feature of Object Oriented Programming. Sub Class: The class
        that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or
        Derived Class. Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by
        sub class is called Base Class or Super class.
      </p>
      <h3>polymorphism</h3>
      <p>
        Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most
        common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs when a parent class reference
        is used to refer to a child class object. Any Java object that can pass
        more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic. In Java, all
        Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test
        for their own type and for the class Object.
      </p>
      <h2>Java Compilation</h2>
      <p>
        Java, being a platform-independent programming language, doesn’t work on
        the one-step compilation. Instead, it involves a two-step execution,
        first through an OS-independent compiler; and second, in a virtual
        machine (JVM) which is custom-built for every operating system.
      </p>
      <p>Java compilation is done in two ways-:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Firstly,source code is converted into byte code by <b>javac</b></li>
        <li>Secondly,byte code is converted into machine code by <b>JVM</b></li>
      </ul>

        <h2 class="bb">SOME IMPORTANT QUES OF JAVA</h2>
        <p><b>Ques1.</b>Why java is known as platform-independent?</p>
        <p>
          <b> Ans1. </b>Java is platform independent because it does not make
          any assumptions about the underlying hardware or operating system.
          This means that Java developers can write their code and run without
          worrying whether they are using Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iOS, Android
          etc.
        </p>
        <p><b>Ques2.</b>Why java known as platform?</p>
        <p>
          <b> Ans2. </b>The Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate
          developing and running programs written in the Java programming
          language. A Java platform includes an execution engine (called a
          virtual machine), a compiler and a set of libraries; there may also be
          additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the
          requirements.
        </p>
        <p><b>Ques3.</b>Why class is known as object factory?</p>
        <p>
          <b> Ans3. </b>A class is called an object factory because objects are
          created from the class that contains common attributes and behaviour.
          The class behaves like a specification for creating such similar
          objects.
        </p>
        <p><b>Ques4.</b>Why class is known as instance of object?</p>
        <p>
          <b> Ans4. </b> class can create objects of itself with different
          characteristics and common behaviour. So, we can say that an Object
          represents a specific state of the class. For these reasons, an Object
          is called an Instance of a Class. Write a statement to create an
          object 'Keyboard' of the class 'Computer'.
